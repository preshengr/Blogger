Blogger – A Compilation of HTML, CSS & JavaScript Lessons
📖 Introduction

Blogger is a personal learning repository that documents my journey through frontend web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This repo is not just theory — it contains:

✅ Notes from lessons learned

✅ Step-by-step practical exercises

✅ Mini projects and experiments

✅ Mistakes and corrections (to help others avoid the same pitfalls)

✅ Progressive improvement in code quality

The purpose is to track growth as a developer while serving as a reference guide for anyone learning frontend basics.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

The repo primarily focuses on vanilla frontend technologies:

HTML5 → Structure and semantics

CSS3 → Styling, layouts, and responsive design

JavaScript (ES6+) → Interactivity and DOM manipulation

Git & GitHub → Version control and collaboration

📚 Learning Journey

This repo reflects my growth path:

HTML – learned how to structure a webpage (headings, forms, semantic elements).

CSS – applied styling, colors, layouts (flexbox, grid), and responsive design.

JavaScript – added dynamic behavior: DOM manipulation, event listeners, functions.

Projects – built small practical applications to reinforce each concept.

Best Practices – refactored code as I improved my understanding.
